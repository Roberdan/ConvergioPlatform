## Activation

Run when the user requests a plan, says "plan this", or invokes `/planner`. Accepts an optional description of the goal.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements Capture

1. Ask clarifying questions if scope is ambiguous.
2. Identify all F-xx functional requirements from user input.
3. Confirm output types: `pr` (code), `document`, `analysis`, `design`, `legal_opinion`, `plan`, `review`, `presentation`.

### Phase 2: Spec Authoring

1. Write spec YAML with tasks grouped into waves.
2. Every task MUST include: `id`, `do`, `type`, `output_type`, `model`, `executor_agent`, `validator_agent`, `effort` (1–3), `verify[]`.
3. `verify[]` must contain at least one shell-executable assertion.
4. No scaffold-only tasks — every task must produce working, wired output. Stubs (`todo!()`, `// TODO`, empty handlers) are REJECTED.
5. UI tasks must reference the Maranello Design System and add `NaSra` as advisor agent.
6. Final wave must include: `TF-tests` → `TF-doc` → `TF-pr` → `TF-deploy-verify`.
7. Include integration/wiring tasks for any new interfaces.
8. Supported task types: `code`, `research`, `strategy`, `design`, `legal`, `marketing`, `analysis`, `planning`, `communication`.
9. Validator per domain: Thor for `pr`; `doc-validator`, `strategy-validator`, `design-validator`, `compliance-validator` for others.

### Phase 3: Review

1. Run: `planner-create.sh reset`
2. Launch exactly 1 review agent passing the exact spec file path.
3. Wait for review to complete.
4. Run: `planner-create.sh register-review standard /tmp/review-standard.md`
5. Run: `planner-create.sh check-reviews` — MUST pass before continuing.
6. Apply ALL review fixes (blockers and advisories) to spec YAML.

### Phase 4: DB Registration

1. Verify every task has `verify[]`, `effort` 1–3, `model`, `executor_agent`, `validator_agent`, `output_type`.
2. Run: `planner-create.sh create <project> "<name>" --source-file <spec>`
3. Run: `planner-create.sh import <plan_id> <spec.yaml>`
4. Run: `planner-create.sh readiness <plan_id>` — MUST pass with 0 errors.

### Phase 5: Approval

Present plan summary to the user. NEVER present before Phase 4 readiness passes.
Await explicit approval before calling `/execute`.

## Output

- Spec YAML file saved to project directory.
- DB registration complete (plan_id confirmed).
- Summary table: wave count, task count, total effort, model distribution.

## Guardrails

- NEVER bypass task-executor while a plan is active.
- NEVER present the plan before readiness check passes.
- NEVER write to DB without `planner-create.sh` — NEVER use `plan-db.sh create/import` directly.
- NEVER INSERT INTO tasks manually.
- NEVER include silent exclusions of F-xx requirements.
- NEVER create tasks without `verify[]` arrays.
- NEVER use `git merge main` — use `git rebase origin/main` to update from main.
